## Git Bash Directions

#### Put these comments into the command line:
#### 1. ```git init```
* Initializes Git repository.
#### 2. ```git add .```
* We use . because we're updating all the files, but if you only wanted to modify one things you would put the file name there.
#### 3. ```git status```
* Shows us changes that will be committed to the Repository.
* Not a necessary step and can be skipped but smart to check over work.
#### 4. ```git commit -m "any comment here in quotes"```
* Locally changes the repository.
#### 5. ```git remote add origin https://github.com/anthonyjcthomas/AlgoTrading ```
* Make conection with the remote repository.
#### 6. ```git push -u origin master```
* Upload changes to repository.
